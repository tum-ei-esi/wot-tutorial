# Web of Things Tutorial by ESI

In this tutorial you will find three folders. 
`1_Preliminary` and `2_Coffee_Machine` are the first tutorials that have been written.
They are still valid and can be done to learn Web of Things.
If you think you know Linux, git, JSON Schema and Node.js you can start directly at `2_Coffee_Machine`.
Otherwise, simply start at `1_Preliminary` and learn all you can!

On the other hand, `SequentialTutorial` is a new one that goes in more detail and is more instructive.
It has exercises that can be skipped if you know the concept already.

If you are a student in TUM, you can also watch the lecture videos of the IoT Remote Lab by asking for access to <https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/esi/staff/salama/>.
