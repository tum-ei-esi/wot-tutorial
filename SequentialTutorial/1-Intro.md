# Non-technical WoT Intro

Web of Things can be understood from different point of views.
In very simple terms, WoT aims at connecting IoT devices of various vendors without telling them what protocols and platforms to use.
The word Web comes from the fact that the Web managed to build an interoperable layer over different IoT services in 2000s.

However, an image speaks a thousand words. Thus, some videos should be even better.

Please watch the two following videos in the respective order:

1. [Official WoT Explainer Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMFXg-kni0U): This gives you an initial motivation for Web of Things.
2. [Overview of the WoT Conference at Siemens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k4JufTE9MQ): This has opinions of various people on the Web of Things
3. [Short Introduction to Web of Things by Ege Korkan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt_P2BU8e3I): This gives a practical use case of Web of Things in a very short format.

If you think you have seen enough introductory videos and want something more technical, the two following videos are what you are looking for.

1. [Web of Things at the API Specifications Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySLuAIoz0Dg): This is a rather long video but goes into many details of Web of Things. If you are new to Web of Things or Web APIs in general, you can skip this video for now. The corresponding slides are available in [the slides folder](../slides/2020-09-ASC2020-EgeKorkan.pdf).
2. [Web of Things and node-wot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkVrqSs-KOs) : This is a more updated but slightly longer video compared to the previous one. It also has more up to date slides. The corresponding slides are available in [the slides folder](../slides/2022-Geekle%20Nodejs%2022%20-%20EgeKorkan.pdf).
