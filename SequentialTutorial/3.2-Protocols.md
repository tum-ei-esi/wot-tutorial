# Internet Protocols
A basic understanding of commonly used protocols is beneficial for those working on libraries for the Web of Things.
WoT focuses mainly on application-layer protocols in the [OSI Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), such as [HTTP/HTTPS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP), [MQTT](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt/), [CoAP](https://jonathanberi.medium.com/a-field-guide-to-coap-part-1-75576d3c768b).

More advanced examples for would be [WebSockets](https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/#network-intro), [MODBUS TCP/IP](https://www.prosoft-technology.com/kb/assets/intro_modbustcp.pdf), and [OPC UA](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/Core/Part1/v105/docs/5)
