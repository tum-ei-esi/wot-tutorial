# Sequential WoT Tutorial

This tutorial assumes zero knowledge of the technologies, standards and tools that the WoT depends upon.
With each step, you will learn one aspect of WoT.

In comparison to other tutorials, you will see that this one has more steps.
This tries to mimic our upcoming "What is WoT?" series.
Some answers are also provided as a spoiler text.

The overall design of the tutorial aims at first explaining the preliminary concepts and then go into WoT-specific points:

1. Giving basic, non-technical WoT introduction
2. Giving links to "everything"
3. Preliminary concepts that are not developed as part of WoT. What you learn here can be applied elsewhere:
   1. Explaining JSON and JSON Schema and the meaning of payloads in WoT
   2. Showing different communication protocols and the overall architecture for networked devices
   3. Explaining APIs in the Web
4. Web of Things concepts:
   1. Explaining WoT Thing Description
   2. Explaining Binding Templates
   3. Showing how to program a Thing that produces a TD
   4. Showing how to use a TD in a Consumer application
   5. Explaining node-wot
   6. Explaining WoT Discovery
