# Preliminaries

Before learning 
## IDE

Since the technical part starts, have an IDE ready. We recommend you to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
If you are using VS Code, the extension [td-code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arces-wot.td-code) is recommended.

You can use any editor or IDE but make sure that it has support for JSON and JSON Schema and Javascript support is desired.
