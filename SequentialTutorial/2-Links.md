# All WoT Links

Every resource about WoT standardization can be found online in a public website.
In addition to the standards, there are various developer sources.

This list will be extended in the future but here are some initial links:

- WoT Homepage: https://www.w3.org/WoT/
- TD standard: https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/
- WoT Tools: https://www.w3.org/WoT/developers/


If you ever look at a WoT standard at the W3C, if the W3C Favicon (image in the browser tab) is orange, it is an editor's draft that constantly changes. Make sure to read working draft or recommendations with blue W3C favicon.
