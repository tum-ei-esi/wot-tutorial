4. Learning node.js: Choose one of the following
    1. (Free) Simple tutorial: [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/index.htm)
    2. (Free) More about the language and frequently used patterns: [Eloquent](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

  No matter what tutorial, you choose make sure to learn what is:
* The language syntax
* Working with local packages, npm, publishing packages
* Asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises
* JSON format
* Handling basic HTTP requests

5. Learning JSON and JSON Schema:
   1. JSON: JSON is a data payload format, comparable to XML. JSON is very very popular so you should be able to find a lot of help online. A tutorial is [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/json_overview.htm). Never forget that JSON is not specific to any language or platform. You can use [this](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your JSON.
      1. Write the following JSON: An object with properties of every JSON type
      2. Write the following JSON: An array with items of every JSON type

   2. JSON Schema: Finish this non-interactive tutorial: [JSON-schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) (~ 4 hours). This is basically explaining the [specification of JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).
      1. During this tutorial, keep writing small JSON Schemas and validating them with an online JSON Schema validator. [An example](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/)
      2. Write a JSON Schema for 1.1. This means that your JSON in 1.1 should pass this schema but e.g. a JSON with a property that should be boolean but isn't should not pass.
      3. Same for 1.b
      4. Write a JSON Schema that gives the following validation results:
   
      ```
        [1,2,3,4]  OK

        [3,2,4,1] OK

        [1,2,3,4,3] Not OK

        [1,2,3,5] Not OK

        [1,1,1,1] Not OK
   ```

      5. Write a JSON Schema that gives the following validation results:

   ```
            { "led": 32 ,
            "color": {"red":20, "blue":40, "green":20 }
            }  OK

            { "led": 32 ,
            "color": {"red":20, "blue":40, "green":20 },
            "tyuiejtysahb": any type except array
            } Not OK

            { "led": 32 ,
            "color": {"red":20, "blue":40, "green":20 },
            "safdgsdtgjs": []
            } OK

            { "led": 32 ,
            "color": {"red":20, "blue":40, "green":20 },
            "aosfdihsdsa":[]
            } OK

            { "led": 32 ,
            "color": {"red":20, "blue":40, "green":20 },
            "gahfodasfh":[]
            } OK
   ```
